# CSS calc() Function Errors
This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the CSS `calc()` function: unexpected behavior or errors due to invalid calculations or syntax.  The `bug.css` file showcases incorrect usage, leading to unexpected rendering.  The solution, found in `bugSolution.css`, provides the correct implementation.

## Bug Description:
The original CSS uses `calc()` to dynamically calculate values. However, improper spacing and potential for negative values lead to rendering issues.  This is a common mistake for developers unfamiliar with the strict syntax requirements of `calc()`. 

## Solution:
The corrected CSS ensures proper spacing in the calculation and handles potential negative value issues by using `max()` or `clamp()` to ensure a valid, non-negative result.
