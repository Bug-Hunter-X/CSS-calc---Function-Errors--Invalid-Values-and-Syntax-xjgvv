The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, if the calculation results in a value that is invalid for the property it's applied to, unexpected behavior might occur. For example, if the `calc()` expression results in a negative value for a property that cannot accept negative values, such as `width` or `height`, then it might be ignored or cause the element to render improperly.  Another common issue is forgetting spaces around the plus, minus, or multiplication/division operators within the `calc()` expression, which can lead to parsing errors.
